This is a Blackjack game made with html, css, and javascript. The logic I used to deal the cards is like an endless random deck. If you play blackjack in a casino, you might be playing with 3, 4, 5 or more decks. So I made a function to return random numbers and associated
them with the card number and suit. Just click on the chips in the lower left corner, then click on Bet to deal the cards. Hope you enjoy!
